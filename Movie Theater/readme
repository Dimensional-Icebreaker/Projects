Movie Theater Management System
This is a Movie Theater Management System implemented in C Programming. The system uses FIFO (Queue) and LIFO (Stack) data structures to manage ticket bookings, cancellations, and seat allocations. It also features a multi-hall tracking system using zip codes and an ASCII-based Command Line Interface (CLI) for user interaction.

Prerequisites
GCC Compiler: Ensure you have the GCC compiler installed to compile the C program.

Linux/Unix-based System: The commands provided are for Linux/Unix-based systems. For Windows, consider using tools like Cygwin or WSL.
